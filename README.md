Boys and girls went to the base. Everyone ate food and had fun. 
But the next day we decided to decide how much to share. 
The girls ate less than the boys, because they are girls, they just can't fit so much.
So it's a shame they have to fork out the same amount of money for the food. What do we do?
The programme will help to calculate how much each person has to give up.
