-Hello, John!

-Hello, Kate!

-How much do I have to lose for our holiday, the food was lovely!

-Kate, you owe $100 like the rest of us. -You owe $100.

-But you boys eat more than we do, why should the girls get $100 off like the boys? 

-Hmm, you're right Kate, we need to figure this out. I think I know a programme for that!



Boys and girls went to the base. Everyone ate food and had fun. 
But the next day we decided to decide how much to share. 
The girls ate less than the boys, because they are girls, they just can't fit so much.
So it's a shame they have to fork out the same amount of money for the food. What do we do?
The programme will help to calculate how much each person has to give up.
